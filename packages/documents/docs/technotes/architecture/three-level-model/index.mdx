# Project Model

## Abstract

To help developers and content creators manage their application properly, we
built a three-level model. This model can ease the mental burden of maintaining
your resources, creating enough flexibility for different deploying target.

Developers can choose technology stacks at different levels of complexity to
solve different tasks. In this article, we will give a brief introduction to
this three-level model.

## Introduction

Recative System manage its content with such a three level model:

<ThreeLevelModel
  style={{
      maxWidth: "184px",
      padding: '0 16px',
      float: "right",
  }}
  alt="The three level model of the Recative System"
/>

* **Asset:** Asset is the minimum unit of an independent content, it could be a
  piece of video, or a small piece of web application based on PIXI.js. You can
  expect there would be more possible options in the future.
* **Episode:** Episode is the minium unit of data loading, resource
  management and lifecycle management. while an episode is initializing, we will
  trying to download an asset definition list, preload all resources if the
  resource definition required. If your enviroment implemented an cache method,
  the episode manager will also try to download the resource to local hard-disk,
  which will boost the initialize speed for further visits.
* **Series:** If your content is too complex to be handled in one single episode,
  you can split your assets into different episodes, and add all episodes into
  one single series. The series manager will manage the lifecycle of each single
  episode. Since loading a new episode needs fetching additional data,
  performance may be compermised, please make a good trade-off between high RAM
  usage and extended load times.

For different level of abstraction, we have different packages to take care of
lifecycles , RAM consumption and performance issue.

<ThreeLevelPackage
  style={{
      maxWidth: "184px",
      padding: '0 16px',
      float: "right",
  }}
  alt="Four level of packages for the three level model"
/>

* **`ap-core`:** `@recative/ap-core` is a set of toolkits for building 
  simple interactive content, we implemented several scheduling machnism to help
  developers building an web application with less performance issue. Currently,
  there's an official support of [PIXI.js](https://pixijs.com/),
  [Yoga Layout](https://yogalayout.com/), [anime.js](https://animejs.com/),
  the support for [three.js](https://threejs.org/) and
  [Tone.js](https://tonejs.github.io/) is under construction.

:::caution
Although our customers have built quite a few content products using ap-core,
the API design has not yet reached the level of public availability. We are
trying to disassemble `@recative/ap-core` into multiple smaller packages, to
reduce the complexity of the whole solution.
:::

* **Act Player:** `@recative/act-player` is a React component which can render
  a lot of *assets*. [`EpisodeCore`](/api/core-manager/class/EpisodeCore) 
  of [`@recative/core-manager`](http://localhost:3000/api/core-manager) can take
  care of the task of lifecycle management and RAM management. The implementation
  of core manager is "ui-frame neutral", it is useful if your team is not using
  [React](https://reactjs.org/) or want to build a different product based on
  the existing system. The interface of this player is full-customizable, you can
  pass your own implementation of every single component. Reading the following
  articles for more details about how to customize it. 

* **SDK:** `@recative/client-sdk` is a React component for managing multiple
  episodes, client sdk will take care of data fetching and life cycle management,
  and interface customize. If you are building a product which have multple
  episodes, SDK could be helpful. *SDK* also support interface customize, by
  building an interface component - an ESM module which exports a React hook - 
  you can customize all possible behavior and visual experience with this 
  feature without hacking the source code of *act player*.

* **Shell:** Shell is the enviroment your application or program running in, it
  could be a website, a desktop client or a mobile application. There could be 
  different kind platform-specific capabilities, like in app purchase, resource
  cache, sharing or deeplink. We're trying our best to build a set of official 
  shell implementation for most use cases. For users without special requirements, 
  we encourage you to use the official shell implementation, which is better
  integrated into *Recative Studio*'s workflow. If you want to customize the
  capability of shells, please fork our official implementation. We will
  introduce how the Shell interacts with Recative Studio in the following article.

:::tip
The source code and implementation will be revealed later, since we are adding
some final touch to it.
:::

:::tip
It's not necessary to fork the shell implementation if you only want to
customize the visual experience of the player, consider building a *"interface
component"* can greatly improve the maintainability of the project.

## Use Cases

Since episode core manager includes many media manage feature, you can also use
act player as a na√Øve video player with cross-browser and cross-platform
consistent auto play behavior.
Such a use case is supported, but we are still trying to improve its autoplay
ability.
